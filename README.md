![Mockup](assets/images/mockup.png)

Website presents the gym Best Wellness, their services, and the gym itself.
Potential members will be able to see pictures of the gym, see the classes the gym offers, and read about the benefits of going to the gyn

This project is for educational purposes and can not be used as a template for business use.
Main aim is to build responsive website with HTML and CSS only. I will use Bootstrap framework to keep website consent and clear.
